# IAIoTSecurity - Exploration of artificial intelligence techniques applied to the detection of security incidents in IoT networks.

## Description

This study focuses on the development of a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System tailored for the Internet of Things with a specific application in Smart Farming. To address the challenge of securing IoT devices in agriculture, we created a realistic scenario to simulate various types of attacks, including Denial of Service and Spoofing. Data from these scenarios were collected, cleaned, and pre-processed to train the selected Machine Learning models. The processed data resulted in the creation of a dataset, which has been made publicly available through the Zenodo platform, contributing to the academic-scientific field.

The developed IDS model demonstrated great performance across various metrics, highlighting its robustness and reproducibility in real-world scenarios. This research project holds significant implications for IoT and cybersecurity, as it effectively mitigates vulnerabilities and reduces the occurrence of attacks in the rapidly expanding IoT ecosystem.

The study emphasizes the crucial role of Machine Learning algorithms in intrusion detection systems, offering valuable insights and a roadmap for future research and practical implementation of such systems in real environments. With binary classification accuracy rates of 92,67% and 86,91%, and multiclass classification accuracy rates of 76,37% and 74,96%, our solution contributes to creating a safer and more secure IoT ecosystem in Smart Farming.
